Hello

Couple of pointers:

- Please learn Git and submit a repo with your code and your question.
- Please use Stack Overflow to find information
- Also use virtualenv to manage your python deps.

How to run this solution:
- Create a virtualenv `virtualenv .venv`, it should be picked up by vscode
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python main.py`
